This repository is smaller version of libraries like pytorch and tensorflow (using values instead of tensors) to demonstrate understanding of the underlying concepts behind neural networks.

I watched the video explanation by Andrej Karpathy, then tried to implement this same concept myself without references the micrograd code. This repository is purely meant as an academic exercise and not meant to be used by others - there are probably many bugs.
